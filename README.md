# Credit-Scoring-HomeCredit
Final Project of Rakamin Virtual Internship Experience - Predicting whether a loan is going to be repaid or not

The objective is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not a loan will be repaid. This is a standard supervised classification task:

Supervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.

Classification: The label is a binary variable, 0 (will repay loan on time), 1 (will have difficulty repaying loan)
